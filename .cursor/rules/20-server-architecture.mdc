# Server Architecture

- Keep route handlers thin; delegate logic to services.
- Services should be pure-ish and unit testable.
- Enforce classroom scoping and role checks in server code.
- Keep Colyseus room handlers lightweight and non-blocking.
- Task validation must remain authoritative server-side.
