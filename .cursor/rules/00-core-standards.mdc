# Core Standards

- Keep files under 300 lines; split early.
- Prefer one public export per file; use `index.ts` barrels.
- Add JSDoc to every public function/class/type alias.
- Use explicit types on public APIs and function returns.
- Do not introduce implicit side effects in utility modules.
- No dead code, commented blocks, or placeholder TODOs without ticket tags.
