# Content Schema Rules

- Every task file must include id, type, title, description, config, rewards.
- Task IDs are stable once released; do not repurpose existing IDs.
- Validate content through `pnpm content:validate`.
- Keep task config fields explicit and version-compatible.
- Prefer additive schema changes over breaking changes.
