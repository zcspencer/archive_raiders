# Testing Rules

- Add tests for new domain logic and bug fixes.
- Prefer pure-function tests for validators and utilities.
- Include negative-path tests for auth and validation flows.
- Keep tests deterministic; avoid hidden time/network dependencies.
- Test names should describe behavior and expected outcomes.
