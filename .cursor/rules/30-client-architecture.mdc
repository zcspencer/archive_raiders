# Client Architecture

- Phaser handles world rendering and movement only.
- React handles HUD, menus, and task overlays.
- Bridge via typed events and store actions, not direct coupling.
- Keep task components self-contained and typed by task definition.
- Never trust client validation for authoritative outcomes.
