# Agent Working Agreement

Use these standards for all future implementation work.

## Code standards

- Keep files below 300 lines.
- Keep modules focused and explicit.
- Prefer pure functions and typed interfaces.
- Document public API behavior with JSDoc.

## Process standards

- Work in small, testable increments.
- Do not silently change shared contracts.
- Update docs when architecture or contracts change.
- Add tests for all non-trivial logic.

## Handoff standards

- Record scope and changed files.
- Record commands run and outcomes.
- Record unresolved risks and assumptions.
- Suggest the next smallest useful step.
